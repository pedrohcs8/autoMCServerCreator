This is a project created for facilitating the creation of minecraft servers locally via docker using [itzg/minecraft-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server).

**This tool requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**

**Installation Methods**

This tool can be installed in two ways, either cloning the repository and running main.py:

``
git clone https://github.com/pedrohcs8/autoMCServerCreator.git
python3 main.py
``

Or reaching into [releases]() and running the standalone script:

``python3 standalone-creator.py``

**Utilization**

The program is very staight-forward, by running it you will be prompted to choose the type of the server and ask for some info for creating the server.
